## Functional JavaScript Next Steps

### _New paradigms take practice!_

Take your learning into your own hands:

- Work on solving small programming problems in a functional style. For example, find a problem from [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/exercises), [Daily Programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/), or a similar site you like, and force yourself to solve it functionally. Better yet write two solutions, one functional and one imperative, to compare paradigms in context and reinforce your learning.
- Feel like reading rather than coding? Dive deeper into the topic(s) we're covering by checking out some of the resources listed below.
