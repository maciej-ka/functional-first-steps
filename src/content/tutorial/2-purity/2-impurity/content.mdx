## Managing impurity


You might be wondering: If FP doesn't let us use side effects, confining us to the safe, sterile, deterministic world of pure functions, how can we write any useful real-world programs with it?!?


:::tip

To tackle the practical challenges of FP in the real world, a common technique is to "isolate" impurities by leaving them in the outermost layer of the program, keeping the inner core purely functional.

Refactor the imperative, impure code in `src/render.js`, to separate the _impure_, side-effecting imperative code from the _pure_ inner core functionality, by completing `impureRenderApp()` and `pureGetSVG()`  functions. Make sure the tests in `src/render.test.js` are passing for your solution.
