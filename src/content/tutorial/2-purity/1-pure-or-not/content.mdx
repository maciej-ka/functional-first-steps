### Exercise: Pure or Not?

Read through the functions in `pureOrNot.js`. In the commented lines above each function, replace the `TODO`s to indicate whether each function is pure or not, and why. You may want to consult [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) if you're unsure of the functionality of any builtins.

Then, compare your answers to my solution and discuss with the larger group. Were there any surprises?
