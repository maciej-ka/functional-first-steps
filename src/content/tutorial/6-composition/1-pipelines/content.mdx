### Functional Pipelines


:::info

In functional programming we construct programs entirely out of modular pure functions, using function composition to "combine" several functions' effects to create a pipeline through which our program's data can flow.

:::


Complete the `pipe` function in `funpro.js`. This function takes as arguments any number of single-argument functions, and should return a single function representing their composition, i.e. a function that passes the input value through a "pipeline" of the functions.

:::tip

Hints:
- We've said it before, we'll say it again: recursion is a functional programmer's best friend!
- The `length`, `head`, and `tail` functions we saw earlier may come in handy!
- You can use JavaScript's spread syntax (...) to expand an array as arguments to a function when you don't know how many arguments there will be (e.g. doSomething(...howeverManyArguments))
