### Recursion vs. Iteration

In the file `src/fibonacci.js`, complete the functions `imperativeFibonacci` and `recursiveFibonacci` to compute the Nth number in the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) (`fibonacci.js`). Make sure the test suite passes.


Which version did you find easier to write? Why?


Try running both functions with higher and higher input numbers. Do you notice any differences in behavior or performance?
