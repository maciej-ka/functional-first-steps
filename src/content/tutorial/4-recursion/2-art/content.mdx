## The _Art_ of Recursion

Complete the `diamondPattern` function in `patterns.js` to generate some recursive art! 

 When this function is complete, you should see an image with nested diamonds of alternating colors, like this: 

<p class="w-50 m-auto">

<Image name='diamonds' />

</p>

Try playing with the pattern parameters and making your own art!
