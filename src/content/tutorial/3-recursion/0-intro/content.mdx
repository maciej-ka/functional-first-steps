## Recursive functions <SlidesLink url="https://observablehq.com/embed/@anjana/staying-out-of-the-loop-with-recursion?cell=*" />

:::info

In functional programming, we avoid mutable state, and therefore avoid iterative loops using `for` or `while`. As an alternative to iteration, we use _recursion_ to break down the problem into smaller ones.

A recursive function has two parts:
- _base case_: condition(s) under which the function returns an output without making a recursive call  
- _recursive case_: condition(s) under which the function calls itself to return the output

### Comparing readability


In `factorial.js` there are two versions of a function to compute the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a given positive integer n: one function takes an iterative approach, the other uses recursion.

Take a moment to read & understand both functions. Feel free to add comments to explain what each line does, and/or try out the functions by calling them with different inputs.

Which one do you find more readable? Why?

Do you notice any differences in behavior or performance?
