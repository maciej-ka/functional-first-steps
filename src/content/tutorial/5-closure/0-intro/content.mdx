## Getting closure <SlidesLink url="https://observablehq.com/embed/@anjana/getting-closure?cell=*" />


:::info

When a function is defined within another function, the inner function can remember things about the outer function's scope at the time it (the inner function) was defined. When such a function "remembers" values from the defining scope, we call it a _closure_ over those values.

_Fun fact: Closures are so important in FP that they inspired the name of a popular functional language, [Clojure](https://clojure.org), and its frontend counterpart [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) which compiles to JS!_
