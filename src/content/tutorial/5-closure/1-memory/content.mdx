### Functional 'memory' with Closures

:::tip


Closures are useful for "remembering" often-used arguments to functions, as well as for avoiding long function signatures in the stateless functional world where we want to avoid depending on data external to the function. 

:::

In `patterns.js`, complete the stubbed-out functions `makeMonotonePattern` and `makeFixedWidthPattern`. These functions return _closures_ that lock-in arguments to the underlying `diamondPattern` function. Use the test suite to evaluate your implementation.
