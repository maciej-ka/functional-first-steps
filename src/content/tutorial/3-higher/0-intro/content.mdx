## First-Class & Higher-Order Functions <SlidesLink url="https://observablehq.com/embed/@anjana/flying-first-class-with-higher-order-functions?cell=*"/>


:::info

We say a language has "first-class functions" if it supports functions being passed as input or output values of other functions. JS has this feature, and JavaScripters take advantage of it all the time - for example, it's what allows us to pass a callback function as an input parameter for another function. It's also possible to have a function as a return value. A function which either takes or returns another function is called a _higher-order_ function.

:::

The higher-order functions `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()` are three of the most useful tools in a functional programmer's toolbox. Let's dig into how they work & how to use them.
